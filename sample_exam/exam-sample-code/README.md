PLEASE NOTE: This code is not "ready to compile"

Since the environment for the final exam is slightly in flux, we are just giving you the raw starting code without a CMake config at this stage. For now simply copy and paste these files into the cpp-cmake, exercises, or assignments and reconfigure CMake (post on the forum if you need help). We will endeavour to make an update to this repo that reflects the exam environment more exactingly and keeping it light in the meantime to avoid confusion.
